# CityMeet:

The objective was to build a React-based progressive web application using Google Calendars.

The principles of test-driven, behaviour-driven development and end-to-end testing were applied.

Serverless functions have been used to authorize and access a CareerFoundry event calendar, with Rechart data visualisation added to allow an intuitive breakdown of events by location and topic.

## Build Tools

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), used together with:

  Google Calendar API
  
  Testing with Jest, Enzyme and Cucumber
  
  Progressive Web App
  
  Serverless functions (OAuth) hosted by Amazon AWS
  
  React-bootstrap styling
  
  Rechart data visualisation
  
  Hosting on GitHub Pages (https://swingwing777.github.io/buster-citymeet/)
  
## Privacy Policy

This project is for developer education purposes only, with all Calendar API data provided by Career Foundry.  

No user information is requested, accessed, stored or otherwise retained by the developer or the developer code. Allowing app access to a user's Google account is needed solely by Google to view the app's functionaility (including that of the AWS hosted serverless functions used to obtain an access token).  Any information exchanged in the authorization process is entirely between the user and Google, and not shared with or stored by the developer or buster-citymeet in any way of form.

Access can be cancelled at any time by the user via their Google account settings.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
